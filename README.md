Python - Webbrowser
-------------------

This is a fun prank program using pythong scripts. In this lesson you will need to import 3 modules: RANDON, TIME, WEBBROSWER.
The main objective of this program is to run a simple while loop that will open web pages over and over again until we break the loop.
